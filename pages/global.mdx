# Globally handling errors

Sometimes we want to handle Promise errors globally instead of per request base. That is possible to do with an event
that catches all unhandled rejected promises:

```jsx
const App = () => {
  const [showError, setShowError] = useState(false);

  const handlePromiseRejection = e => {
    e.preventDefault();

    if (e.name === 'AbortError') {
      return;
    }

    return setShowError(true);
  };

  useEffect(() => {
    window.addEventListener('unhandledrejection', handlePromiseRejection);

    return () => {
      window.removeEventListener('unhandledrejection', handlePromiseRejection);
    };
  }, []);

  return (
    // ...
  );
};
```

While this works in most cases, it usually breaks development mode in both CRA and NextJS. The reason is probably that
both frameworks use the same approach to catch promise errors and show custom error modal with the error code lines in
development mode. That doesn't happen in production so this code would still work and catch errors globally without any
issues. Custom libraries like `axios` have interceptors to achieve similar functionality.
