# Multiple request at same API endpoint

Most of the time when we fire a request we would have spinners preventing us to fire the same request again until the
previous one is finished. A lot of the time, especially in forms, we prevent firing by disabling submit buttons to fire
the request again.

<table><tr><td>
![Landscape](/filters.png)
</td></tr></table>

There are examples when we can't use these approaches and we have to allow a user to fire multiple requests at the same
endpoint in a short period. One of those examples would be an autocomplete input that fetches suggestions on every
change. Another would be fetching a list of filtered results depending on the filter manipulation.

```jsx
const Filters = () => {
  const isMounted = useIsMounted();
  const [filters, setFilters] = useState([]);
  const [order, setOrder] = useState(null);
  const [page, setPage] = useState(1);
  const [search, setSearch] = useState(null);

  const getItems = useCallback(async () => {
    const items = await service.getItems({
      filters,
      order,
      page,
      search
    });
    isMounted(() => setItems(items)); // We're not checking the order of responses
  }, [filters, isMounted, order, page, search]);

  useEffect(() => {
    getItems();
  }, [getItems]);

  return (
    // ...
  );
};
```

In these cases, especially if the connection is unstable or slow, we can potentially get responses in a different order
than the requests. This would result in wrong filtered results that do not correspond to the filters selected. We should
prevent this from happening.

```jsx highlight=1,2,3,4,8,15,16,21,23,25
const timedRequest = async (data, timestamp) => ({
  items: await service.getItems(data),
  timestamp
});

const Filters = () => {
  const isMounted = useIsMounted();
  const timestampRef = useRef();
  const [filters, setFilters] = useState([]);
  const [order, setOrder] = useState(null);
  const [page, setPage] = useState(1);
  const [search, setSearch] = useState(null);

  const getItems = useCallback(async () => {
    timestampRef.current = new Date().getTime();
    const { items, timestamp } = await timedRequest({
      filters,
      order,
      page,
      search
    }, timestampRef.current);
    isMounted(() => {
      if (timestampRef.current === timestamp) {
        setItems(items);
      }
    });
  }, [filters, isMounted, order, page, search]);

  useEffect(() => {
    getItems();
  }, [getItems]);

  return (
    // ...
  );
};
```

This solution works when all the requests finish up successfully. If one of the requests fails and especially if one of
the outdated requests fails, we would have to update the logic to something more profound to handle errors specifically.
But, we won't cover that as there is a better solution by canceling the request.
